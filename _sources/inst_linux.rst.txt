Linux operating systems
=======================

In case this library is planned to be used with the |aiida_page| interface it is recommended to create
a virtual environment to install the packages there.
For linux systems this can be done via the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m venv ~/envs/aim2dat

The environment is then activated,

.. code-block:: bash

    source ~/envs/aim2dat/bin/activate

and the library and its dependencies can be directly installed via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install aim2dat
